The Wee Demo showcases some of Wee 4's great new features.  Features like the router, which has been rebuilt from the ground up with a lot more functionality and usability.

Clone or download the repo, run `npm install` and if you have the wee 4 cli installed, run `wee start`, otherwise run `npm start`
